    <h2>
     Call For Participants
    </h2>
    <p>
     The World History Association of Texas and Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce (TAMUC) invites you to the annual WHAT conference at the Sam Rayburn Student Center at Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce on February 25, 2023.
    </p>
    <p>
     The WHAT conference provides a forum for the discussion of all aspects of World History. Proposals for panels, single papers, round tables, and workshops from research scholars, teachers, and students on any topic related to World History including new research, concepts, or pedagogy are welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
     Our theme for 2023 is &ldquo;Revolutions&rdquo; in World History. We envision the theme broadly, recognizing there are many different types of historical revolutions including those with political, economic, agricultural, linguistic, cultural, social, environmental, scientific, migratory, military, and pedagogical dimensions. We seek to understand the role of these dramatic changes in world history and what they mean for us, in the 21st century.
