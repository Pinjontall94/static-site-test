    <p>
     The&nbsp;

      WHA
     </abbr>
     holds its annual Council meeting, followed by a business meeting, during its annual conference. Each is chaired by the President or, in the President&rsquo;s absence, by the Vice President.
     <abbr title="World History Association">

     </abbr>
     &nbsp;Council meetings are where the nine elected Council members, the four executive officers (President, Vice President, Treasurer, and Secretary), the editors of the&nbsp;
     <abbr title="World History Association">
      WHA
     </abbr>
     &rsquo;s four publications, the Executive Director, committee chairs, former presidents, and invited guests meet to discuss and decide important academic and managerial issues facing the association, with only the nine council members and the four executive officers voting.
    </p>
    <h2>
     WHA Business Meeting
    </h2>
    <p>
     The business meeting, which follows a day or two later, is open to the active participation of all
     <abbr title="World History Association">
      WHA
     </abbr>
     &nbsp;members interested in the state and future of the association. At the business meetings, actions taken at the recent Council meeting are announced, and the Executive Director, President, Treasurer, and other officers, council members, and committee chairs report on issues affecting the association, including budget decisions, cost/profit results and projections, and significant goals and problems. Just as important, the questions and advice of all members in attendance are solicited and recorded. In essence, the business meetings are open forums, and&nbsp;
     <abbr title="World History Association">
      WHA
     </abbr>
     &nbsp;members should consider active attendance at them to be a duty of membership.
